Description:
    A tool to analyze and visualize co-occurrence patterns correlation and mutual exclusivity) between mutational signatures in cancer. The package takes somatic mutation data (VCFs), extracts signature exposures, and computes pairwise co-occurrence metrics. It extends standard signature analysis by focusing on the relationships between signatures, generating visual summaries like clustered heatmaps to reveal novel biological insights.
