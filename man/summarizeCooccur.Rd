\title{Summarize Signature Co-occurrence Patterns}
\usage{
summarizeCooccur(cooccur_matrix, top_n = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{cooccur_matrix}{A square numeric matrix from \code{calcCooccur()}.}

\item{top_n}{An integer (default: 10). The number of top positive and
top negative pairs to return.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{Signature_A}: The name of the first signature.
\item \code{Signature_B}: The name of the second signature.
\item \code{Correlation}: The correlation coefficient.
\item \code{Type}: A categorical label ("Co-occurrence" or
"Mutual Exclusivity") based on the sign of the correlation.
}
}
\description{
Takes the co-occurrence matrix and produces a summary table of
the strongest relationships. It identifies the top co-occurring and mutually
exclusive signature pairs.
}
\details{
The function flattens the square correlation matrix into a long-format
table of unique pairs. It then sorts these pairs by the strength of their
correlation.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Get the top 5 co-occurring and top 5 mutually exclusive pairs
  summary_table <- summarizeCooccur(cooccur_matrix, top_n = 5)

  print(summary_table)
}
}
