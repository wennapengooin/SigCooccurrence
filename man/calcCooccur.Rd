\title{Calculate Pairwise Signature Co-occurrence}
\usage{
calcCooccur(exposure_matrix, method = c("spearman", "pearson"))
}
\arguments{
\item{exposure_matrix}{A numeric matrix of signature exposures
(e.g., the \verb{$contribution} output from \code{extractSigs}).
Must have signatures in rows and samples in columns.}

\item{method}{A character string indicating which correlation coefficient
is to be computed. One of "spearman" (default) or "pearson".}
}
\value{
A square numeric matrix where both rows and columns are
signature names, and the values are the correlation coefficients
(from -1 to 1).
}
\description{
This function takes the signature exposure matrix (the \verb{$contribution} matrix
from \code{extractSigs}) and calculates a pairwise correlation matrix between
all signatures.
}
\details{
The exposure matrix has signatures in rows and samples in columns. To calculate
the correlation between signatures \emph{across samples}, this function
transposes the matrix and uses \code{stats::cor()}.

The \code{method} argument allows you to choose the type of correlation:
\itemize{
\item \strong{"spearman"} (default): Spearman's rank correlation. This is
a non-parametric test that is robust to outliers and non-normal
distributions, which is common in signature exposure data. It assesses
monotonic relationships (i.e., as one signature's exposure increases,
the other consistently increases or decreases, but not necessarily
linearly).
\item \strong{"pearson"}: Pearson's linear correlation. This assesses
linear relationships.
}
The resulting square matrix is the core data for plotting heatmaps and
network graphs.
